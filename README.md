The goal of this project was to design a functional stoplight intersection circuit using logic gates and d flip-flops.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A counter with RESET was implemented the previously mentioned flip-flops to allow the circuit to go back
to it's first state after reaching the final one.

This project was designed and tested in LOGISIM.
